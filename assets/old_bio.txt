"Hey. My name is Freesoul-Kofi. I’m a designer, engineer, and experimental sculptor pursuing work in regenerative design. Born and rooted in Elmina, Ghana, yet growing up throughout the US tristate area has afforded me a cross cultural intuition de l'instant. Emergent from this is my interest in the design of institutions and systems, and how communities and cultures can be engaged differently to iterate on those institutions, structures, and products that impact their lives the most. The core of my work is about exploring and recreating relationships with nature in order to use all we have towards generating wholeness of experience for all. I’m learning more about emergent architecture strategy, technology policy, and business development as means to do this."


I'm passionate about equitable and well informed design. I want to create services, experiences, and products through the entirety of the design and production processes. My research and analytical skills inform a holistic approach to design; I care about the systems we use to solve problems.
