Yo, My name is Freesoul-Kofi. I'm a Design Engineer, Conceptual Artist and
       Creative Director actively pursuing work in regenerative and restorative
       design. From products and architecture to culture and history, my
       research and work focuses on exploring and recreating our relationship
       with nature in order to use all we have towards generating wholeness of
       experience for all

A Generator is a person who, through observation, research, and experimentation, develops specific processes by which a general problem can be solved, or general need can be met. To practice Generation means to give impetus to the creation and arrangment of things, events or spaces that continually resolve the forces of any given system of pattern-relationships.
Activity Sectors: Art, Design, Engineering, Architecture, Sociopolitical
