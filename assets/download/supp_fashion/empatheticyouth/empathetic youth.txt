Empathetic Youth 2016-17

Empathetic Youth was my first solo deep dive into text, and screen printing on cloths, as well as natural dyes. I spent several months documenting relationships (film/text) and wanted to capture the spirit of the friends at the time. Sadly a majority of the footage was lost when a friend of mine lost my hard drive. The project culimated with a series of patches that i sent to my friends across the country. the themes; empathy, trust, danger, love, worry.
