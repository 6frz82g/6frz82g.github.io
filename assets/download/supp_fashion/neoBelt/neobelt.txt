NeoBelt

Modelling/Rendering Exercise
I needed a model for a rendering exercise so I quickly made a concept for a belt made out of neodymium magnets in solidworkds. I decided to brand it as prada but that was an abritrary choice. the textures for the nylon were just grabbed off of google. work done in keyshot 8.
