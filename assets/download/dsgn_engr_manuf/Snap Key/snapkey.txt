Snap Key 2016

The Snap Key was very much my introduction to the design process. This was the project that lead to my saying "I've been doing this my whole life" about design, when I was 18 years old. Our assignment was simple, we were to solve a problem that we all had. My team consisted of very active types, so it's natural that we gravitated towards that arena. Our product, the SnapKey offers runners the option to securely carry a single key with them while on runs, rather than relying on one of the 30+ work-arounds we observed in research. I produced a video demo of the product, and images along with the final report can be found in the folder.
