Formula SAE 2017-18

I was part of the Aerodynamics subteam on Northwestern Formula Racing for the 2017-18 season. As a member of Aero I spent time using CAD to develop the bodywork of the car as well as learning and using CAM to manufacture molds required for carbon fiber lay-ups. Photos included in folder.
