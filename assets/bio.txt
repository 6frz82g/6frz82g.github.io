"Hey. My name is Freesoul-Kofi. I’m a designer, engineer, and experimental sculptor pursuing work in regenerative design. Born and rooted in Elmina, Ghana, yet growing up throughout the US tristate area has afforded me a cross cultural intuition de l'instant. Emergent from this is my interest in the design of institutions and systems, and how communities and cultures can be engaged differently to iterate on those designs that impact their lives the most.The core of my work is about exploring and recreating relationships with nature in order to use all we have towards generating wholeness of experience for all. I’m learning more about emergent architecture strategy, technology policy, and business development as means to do this."
