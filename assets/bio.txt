Hey. My name is Freesoul, I go by Sol. Iâ€™m a designer, engineer, and artist working across the regenerative design spectrum. I'm passionate about equitable and well informed design. I work to create services, experiences, and products through the entirety of the design and production processes. My research and analytical skills inform a holistic approach to design; I care deeply about the systems we use to solve problems. Central to this is an exploration of how communities and cultures can be engaged differently to iterate on those institutions, structures, and products that impact their lives the most. The core of my work is about exploring and recreating relationships with nature in order to use all we have towards generating wholeness of experience for all.
