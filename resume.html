    <h3>Bio</h3>
    <p>
      I'm a designer, engineer and artist always looking to create and communicate. By bringing the intersection of my skills and interests to communities and individuals, I work to collaboratively iterate on and redefine the institutions, physical structures, and products that impact our lives the most.
      I'm always excited to talk about regenerative and developmental design, radical education, and permaculture!
