          <b>2020 Pittsburgh Racial Justice Summit</b><br><br>
          Members from my community in Pittsburgh asked me to design a flyer. The theme of the summit this year was <a href="#">1619-2020 Decolonize Our Histories to Reclaim Our Humanity</a>.
          I went outside and took a picture of the sky, but that wasn't so pretty so I found a free image online and used that for the background.
          The pattern of circles is an overlay of the motion of stars surrounding a black hole, the ultimate event horizon.
          I really dislike didatic and representative illustrations (unless it's a presentation or something like that), so in the pattern my aim was to
          communicate an experience of form, that we, much like the stars, are approaching an inevitable event horizon which calls us to decolonize our histories.
          I provided two front and back variations and they ended up choosing the bottom left and top right for the front and back respectively.

          <b>CattleTech</b> 2018-19<br><br>
          Our client, Raitong Organics, presented the following situations: 1) Cattle wander onto roads where they cannot be seen, thus endangering themselves and drivers.
          2) Cattle herding conventions provide the opportunity for cows to feed on other farmers crops, which is property damage.
          Our solution needed to be low cost, easily manufacturable/repariable, and accessible to the older generation of Thai farmers.
          We increased cattle visibility with a hi-vis collar, and created an open source system for tetherless containment of cattle using Long Range Radios.<br>
          My role on the team was hardware lead as well as being a part of the software and visibility design teams.
          This project is scheduled to resume in winter 2019 with a new team.
          Our research, design propositions, design summary and initial testing can be found here:

          <b>Nora the Dragon</b> 2018<br><br>
          Part of our unofficial manufacturing capstone is a course that focuses on computer integrated manufacturing, specifically applied to the injection molding process.
          Our project for the course was to interpret a sketch provided by a local gradeschooler and to use our CAD skills to brings said sketch to life as a toy.
          In order to produce the toy we furthered our CAM skills and used Haas routers to mill molds. Using the department injection molding machine we produced a run of the product.

          <b>Rel8Ball</b> 2017<br><br>
          The Rel8ball project is an exercise in ux/ui design that draws upon product design skills as well.
          Our goal was to develop a product/service that would promote mental health conversations.
          We imagined a tool for connecting with others--that made having tough conversations easier.
          Our theoretical landscape for this product was that of a counselor or therapists office in which new patients tend to feel nervous about opening up.
          We also imagined a game played among friends.
          The product interfaces with the users smart phone: the user goes to shakeeee.github.io and inserts their phone into the handheld.
          The <a href="https://github.com/surirain/shakeeee.github.io">code</a> uses the phones accelerometer/gyroscope in order to trigger a random question or prompt from an uploaded library.
          Currently there's only one library, but future iterations could have libraries relating to relationships or pressures from school/work etc.
          In practice the app works like a magic 8 ball, from which it gets it's design and name.
          My role on the team was software lead (this was my first time trying web dev stuff, so I learned a lot).

          <b>Formula SAE</b> 2017-18<br><br>
          Formula SAE took over my life for a little over a year.
          I was part of the Aerodynamics subteam on Northwestern Formula Racing for the 2017-18 season.
          As a member of Aero I spent time using CAD to develop the bodywork of the car as well as learning and using CAM to manufacture molds required for carbon fiber lay-ups.

          <b>Bionic Wrench</b> 2019<br><br>
          The Bionic Wrench was developed by Loggerhead Tools/Prof. Dan Brown whom I studied under.
          The case study focuses on the design for assembly and design for manufacturing processes.
          Our task was to create assembly jigs and methodology that could theoretically be used in Prof. Browns factories without any knowledge as to how his system works.
          The unique situation and challenge of pursuing a design direction adjacent to an existing product required thorough teamwork, heavy leaning into rapid prototyping techniques and expert consultation.
          The process opened my eyes to the complexities of real-world manufacturing and excited my intuition for working within an intersection of design constraints.
          In the end our team was very successful, developing a jig and system capable of completely 8 wrenches in 20 minutes, just shy of the record for the class.

          <b>Snap Key</b> 2016<br><br>
          The Snap Key was very much my introduction to the design process. This was the project that lead to my saying "I've been doing this my whole life" about 'design', when I was 18 years old.
          Our assignment was simple, we were to solve a problem that we all had.
          My team consisted of very active types, so it's natural that we gravitated towards that arena.
          Our product, the SnapKey offers runners the option to securely carry a single key with them while on runs, rather than using one of the 30+ unreliable work-arounds we observed in research.
          I produced a video demo of the product, and images along with the final report can be found here: <a href="assets/dl/SnapKey.zip" title="download" download>snapkey.zip</a>
